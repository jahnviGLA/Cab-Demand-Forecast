# Cab Ride Demand Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts the **expected number of cab ride requests** based on environmental and temporal conditions such as **temperature, humidity, and hour of the day**.  
The trained model is deployed using a **Flask backend** and accessed through a **web-based interface**.

--- 

## Project Motivation

Cab ride demand in urban areas varies significantly depending on time, weather, and human activity patterns.  
Incorrect demand estimation often leads to:
- Longer passenger waiting times
- Idle drivers during low demand
- Revenue loss for cab companies

Accurate demand forecasting helps in **smart cab allocation**, **efficient resource utilization**, and **better customer experience**.

## Objective

To design and deploy a Machine Learning-based system that:
- Predicts cab ride demand based on real-world conditions
- Demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow from training to deployment
- Provides a simple and interactive user interface for prediction

---

## Machine Learning Approach

- **Problem Type:** Regression  
- **Target Variable:** Number of cab ride requests  
- **Final Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor  

### Models Evaluated
- Linear Regression (baseline model)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- **Random Forest Regressor (selected model)**

Random Forest was selected due to its superior performance, ability to handle non-linear relationships, and robustness against overfitting.

---

## Performance Metrics

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Low value indicating accurate predictions  
- **R² Score:** High value indicating strong explanatory power  

The model explains most of the variance in cab demand and produces reliable forecasts.
